# Fermionic Universe Hypothesis (FUH)

Single fermionic field with four-fermion interactions forms condensates:
- Dark matter in low-density regions (galaxy stability)
- Dark energy in expanding universe (cosmic acceleration)  
- Black holes in ultra-dense areas (horizons as phase boundaries)

Visible particles emerge from field excitations. Gravity and EM build 5% baryonic matter on 95% dark background.

**Lagrangian:** L_eff = ψ(iγ^μ∇_μ - m_eff)ψ - Λ_eff - (1/4)F_μνF^μν + R/(16πG_ind) + higher terms.

Unifies universe energy budget, resolves ΛCDM tensions.
